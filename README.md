This program stimulates how inventory is managed.

It contains:
1. invenPro.py main sourcefile for the project:
   It contains function to:
       -->print  bill after each purchase.
       -->update currtbill.txt which stores last bill processed.
       -->update allbill.txt which stores all bills processed.
       -->update inventory.json which is json file to mirror a sample inventory.

2. currtbill.txt which stores last bill processed.
3. allbill.txt which stores all bills processed.

By default I have added 6 unique items in the inventory with given rates and quantity.
Also i have performed some function so there will be already some print on both the text file.
For selecting items to purchase, user must enter valid order_id(not name or anything alse).

It would be vely helpful if you suggest some change or functionality addition.
